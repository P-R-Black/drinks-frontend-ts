# Keep's Guide

A web application for cocktail recipes that provides professional and novice mixologists with the instructions needed to craft their cocktail or shot of choice.


## Why (Motivation for Creating)

There are many popular sites that provide cocktail recipes, but they tend to give several paragraphs of information about the drink before revealing the recipe.  While out, I've witnessed bartenders referring to these sites to get a drink recipe, and scrolling through useless information in order to get to the ingredients and recipe. 

Keep's Guide was created as a recipe guide for bartenders, aspiring bartenders and home mixologists who need the recipe without a backstory. Whether looking for a refresher on how to make an old favorite or trying to find a new favorite drink, Keep's Guide will give you the drink's recipe, mixing instructions and little else.
